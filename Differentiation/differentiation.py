    Your goal, back at air traffic control, is to determine the speed of the
    plane.

    Successive readings for alpha and beta at integer times t=7,8,...,14
    are stored in the file plane.npy. Each row in the array represents a
    different reading; the columns are the observation time t, the angle
    alpha (in degrees), and the angle beta (also in degrees), in that order.
    The Cartesian coordinates of the plane can be calculated from the angles
    alpha and beta as follows.

    x(alpha, beta) = a tan(beta) / (tan(beta) - tan(alpha))
    y(alpha, beta) = (a tan(beta) tan(alpha)) / (tan(beta) - tan(alpha))

    Load the data, convert alpha and beta to radians, then compute the
    coordinates x(t) and y(t) at each given t. Approximate x'(t) and y'(t)
    using a first order forward difference quotient for t=7, a first order
    backward difference quotient for t=14, and a second order centered
