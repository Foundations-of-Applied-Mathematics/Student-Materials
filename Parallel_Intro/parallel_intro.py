    Parameters:
        n (int): number of draws to make
        
    Returns:
        means (list of float): the mean draws of each engine

        maxs (list of float): the maximum draws of each engine.

    your function from problem 2 . To time the process serially, run the drawing
    function in a for loop N times, where N is the number of engines on your machine.
    Plot the execution times against n.
