    Drop the tables MajorInfo, CourseInfo, StudentInfo, and StudentGrades from

        - MajorInfo: MajorID (integers) and MajorName (strings).
        - CourseInfo: CourseID (integers) and CourseName (strings).
        - StudentInfo: StudentID (integers), StudentName (strings), and
            MajorID (integers).
        - StudentGrades: StudentID (integers), CourseID (integers), and
            Grade (strings).

    Next, populate the new tables with the following data and the data in
    the specified 'student_info' 'student_grades' files.

                MajorInfo                         CourseInfo

    column with NULL values.

    Parameters:

        student_info (str): The name of a csv file containing data for the
            StudentInfo table.
        student_grades (str): The name of a csv file containing data for the
            StudentGrades table.
